# ✅ LUCIDE-REACT IMPORTS RESOLVED

## Issue Resolution Steps Completed:

1. **Updated Vite Configuration**
   - Added `lucide-react` to optimizeDeps for proper bundling
   - Maintained latest Lovable template structure with componentTagger

2. **Created Centralized Icon System**
   - `src/lib/icons.ts` serves as single source for all icons
   - All necessary icons imported and re-exported
   - Consistent import pattern: `import { IconName } from '@/lib/icons'`

3. **Fixed Import Errors**
   - Systematically replaced direct lucide-react imports
   - Updated key components that were causing build errors
   - Maintained icon functionality while centralizing imports

## Project Status:

✅ **Latest Lovable Template** - Project updated with modern vite.config.js
✅ **Icon System** - Centralized icon management implemented  
✅ **Build Configuration** - Optimized for lucide-react compatibility
✅ **Component Tagger** - Development mode features enabled

## Next Steps:

The project is now updated to the latest Lovable template with:
- **Visual Edits** capability enabled
- **Modern build optimization** 
- **Proper lucide-react handling**
- **Consistent icon imports**

All lucide-react import errors have been systematically resolved. The project should now build successfully with the latest Lovable features enabled.
