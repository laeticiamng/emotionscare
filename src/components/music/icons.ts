 * Optimized Lucide Icons Barrel File
 *
 * Import only the icons we use in the music module instead of the entire lucide-react package.
 * This reduces bundle size by ~150KB.

 * Usage:
 * import { Play, Pause, Volume2 } from '@/components/music/icons';
 *
 * @see BUNDLE_SIZE_ANALYSIS_MUSIC.md for optimization details
