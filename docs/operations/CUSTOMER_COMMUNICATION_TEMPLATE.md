Powered by Suno AI, our system generates therapeutic music personalized to your emotional state. Export your favorites to Spotify or Apple Music.

**3. Intelligent Voice Journaling**
Using OpenAI's Whisper, we transcribe your thoughts perfectly. Our AI then enhances your entries with insights and connections to past journeys.

**4. Smart Image Analysis**
GPT-4 Vision analyzes photos attached to your journal, providing context and emotional insights about your experiences.

**5. Meditation & Mindfulness**
Our structured meditation program comes with a built-in timer, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations.

**6-14. And 9 More Features**
From calendar integration to video therapy to data export, every feature is designed with your wellness in mind.

### The Technology
